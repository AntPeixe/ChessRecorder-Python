# **ChessRecorder with Python**

This program was developed during a university course and it's main focus was to record every play of a chess game with the help of the SimpleCV framework.

The program doesn't actually reconize each piece, it simply understands where they stand and calculate the moves with the difference between the images (before and after play).

A more detailed info is provided in the .pdf file (written in Portuguese)
